Task:
[Create an AI chat bot as an iOS app using the Swift programming language. Ensure compatibility for uploading to the iOS AppStore through Xcode and the Apple Developer platform. The app's purpose is to assist fantasy football players in making informed decisions related to trades, player selections, and lineup choices. Implement user authentication for login/signup, a chat interface with a text box for input, and a display for conversations. The AI should function similarly to the Chat GPT app, providing real-time data on players and their value. Establish a method, such as web scraping, API integration, or database use, for supplying the AI with up-to-date player data. If utilizing a MySQL database, include a creation script within the project and provide clear instructions on its execution. The goal is to deliver a user-friendly AI-powered iOS app that seamlessly integrates real-time player data for enhanced fantasy football decision-making.]
